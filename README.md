# Plinko_Board-C_Programming
This program parses various text files formatted as plinko boards. It essentially plays a game of plinko after reading in the text files and then estimates the various probability of the puck(T) landing in respective slots after running the game N times. This project was useful for practicing reading from external files and implementing calculations in the C language. This was also an introductory exercise to using timers and system pauses within C. It can run as many boards as there are text files available, as executed by the user from the command line. There is also a Makefile attached to gain experience with C compilation.
